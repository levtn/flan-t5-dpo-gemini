# FLAN-T5 Direct Preference Optimization with Gemini Evaluation

An experimental project exploring Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning of FLAN-T5 using Gemini-generated questions and AI-based preference evaluation. This project demonstrates the challenges and limitations of applying advanced fine-tuning techniques to small language models.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was designed as a **learning exercise** to explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) techniques, not to create a functional legal AI system. The experiment reveals important limitations about:

- **Model Capacity**: FLAN-T5-small's insufficient capability for complex reasoning
- **DPO Effectiveness**: Limited benefits when base model responses are poor quality
- **AI Evaluation Challenges**: Difficulty comparing nonsensical responses
- **Training Data Quality**: Impact of low-quality preference pairs on model performance

## 📊 Key Results

The project successfully demonstrates DPO implementation but **does not achieve meaningful improvements**:

- **Response Quality**: Both original and DPO-trained models often produce nonsensical outputs
- **Evaluation Difficulties**: Gemini frequently rated responses as "TIE" due to poor quality across all options
- **Limited Training Data**: Only 11 usable preference pairs from 45 attempted generations
- **Model Degradation Risk**: DPO training may actually harm the model's general capabilities

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Model Configuration
- **Base Model**: `google/flan-t5-small` (77M parameters)
- **Training Method**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- **Framework**: Transformers + TRL library
- **Evaluation**: Gemini 1.5 Flash for preference judgments
- **Environment**: Google Colab (CPU training)

### DPO Pipeline Architecture
```python
# Core components
FlanT5PairGenerator -> Gemini Judge -> DPO Training -> Evaluation
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets trl google-generativeai
```

### Environment Variables
```python
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_gemini_api_key"
```

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Gemini API key
3. Open `flant5_dpo_gemini.ipynb` in Google Colab
4. Run all cells to reproduce the experiment

## 🤖 DPO Training Pipeline

### 1. Response Pair Generation
```python
class FlanT5PairGenerator:
    def generate_response_pair(self, question: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
        # Generate two responses with different sampling parameters
        # Temperature 0.3 (conservative) vs 0.8 (creative)
```

### 2. Gemini-Based Evaluation
```python
def judge_with_gemini(self, question: str, response1: str, response2: str):
    # Use Gemini to determine which response is better
    # Criteria: accuracy, clarity, legal terminology, completeness
```

### 3. DPO Training Configuration
```python
DPOConfig(
    num_train_epochs=2,
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    learning_rate=1e-5,
    # CPU-optimized settings
)
```

## 🧪 Experimental Results

### Training Data Generation
- **Attempted**: 45 legal questions
- **Successful Pairs**: 11 usable preference pairs (24% success rate)
- **Common Issues**: Identical responses, nonsensical outputs, evaluation ties

### Sample Model Outputs

**Question**: "What is the legal standard for establishing proximate cause in tort law?"

- **Original**: "Prohibition of a claim"
- **DPO-trained**: "proximate cause"
- **Analysis**: Neither response provides meaningful legal information

**Question**: "Define the elements required to prove negligence in a personal injury case."

- **Original**: "The elements in the case are the following:"
- **DPO-trained**: "A person may have to be taken to the hospital to be liable for his or her injuries, and if this means he or she is not injured."
- **Analysis**: DPO model produces longer but equally incoherent response

### Evaluation Challenges
```python
# Typical Gemini evaluation for poor responses
{
    'winner': 'TIE',
    'reasoning': 'Both responses are completely inadequate and fail to address the legal question.'
}
```

## 🎓 Learning Objectives Achieved

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **DPO Implementation**: Successfully integrated TRL library for preference optimization
- **AI-Assisted Evaluation**: Used Gemini API for automated preference judgment
- **Dataset Construction**: Generated synthetic legal questions and preference pairs
- **Model Comparison**: Systematic before/after evaluation methodology

### Key Insights Gained
1. **Base Model Limitations**: Small models lack foundational knowledge for domain expertise
2. **DPO Requirements**: Preference optimization needs meaningful response quality differences
3. **Evaluation Complexity**: Comparing poor outputs is inherently difficult
4. **Training Data Quality**: High-quality preference pairs are crucial for DPO success

## 🚫 Fundamental Limitations Discovered

### Model Capacity Issues
- **Knowledge Gap**: FLAN-T5-small has insufficient legal knowledge base
- **Reasoning Ability**: 77M parameters inadequate for complex legal reasoning
- **Hallucination Tendency**: Model generates confident but incorrect information

### DPO-Specific Challenges
- **Response Quality**: Cannot optimize preferences between poor responses
- **Training Signal**: Weak preference signal from low-quality pairs
- **Evaluation Reliability**: AI judges struggle with nonsensical comparisons

### Methodological Problems
- **Sample Size**: 11 training pairs insufficient for meaningful learning
- **Domain Mismatch**: General model applied to specialized legal domain
- **Evaluation Bias**: Single AI judge may have systematic biases

## 🔬 Alternative Approaches That Would Work Better

### Technical Solutions
1. **Larger Base Models**: Use 7B+ parameter models with existing legal knowledge
2. **Domain Pre-training**: Start with legally pre-trained models
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combine small models with legal databases
4. **Human Evaluation**: Replace AI judges with legal experts
5. **Synthetic Data Quality**: Use higher-quality legal content generation

### Training Improvements
- **Instruction Tuning**: Focus on following legal reasoning patterns
- **Multi-stage Training**: Combine MLM, SFT, and then DPO
- **Better Baselines**: Compare against properly fine-tuned supervised models
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use automated legal accuracy scoring

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Response Generation Strategy
```python
# Different sampling parameters to create response diversity
response1 = model.generate(temperature=0.3, top_p=0.8)  # Conservative
response2 = model.generate(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.9)  # Creative
```

### Gemini Integration
```python
def judge_with_gemini(question, response1, response2):
    prompt = f"""
    Evaluate based on:
    1. Legal accuracy and completeness
    2. Clarity and organization  
    3. Use of proper legal terminology
    4. Comprehensiveness of the answer
    5. Professional tone
    """
```

### DPO Training Process
```python
dpo_trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=preference_dataset,
    # CPU-optimized configuration
)
```
